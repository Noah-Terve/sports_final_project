Summary of our Project:
Our goal is to find the volatility of players produced by colleges based on performance in the NBA after graduation. We will do this by compiling a list of players for each university
and calculating their value (by a currently undetermined method) and presenting some general stats on each university such as highest, lowest, and standard deviation of player value.

Actionability:
The actionable part of this project will be showing potential risk when drafting players that are highly rated based on their university. For example if the number 1 draft pick is from
a university that has high volatility then you might opt for the number 2 pick who is from a much more consistent university because their value is likely to be more consistant.

Data to be Used:
We are going to use a data set that contains a list of players from 1947 to 2022 and the colleges they were drafted from (we will only take players who have had a chance to progress
in their career, so were drafted more than 5 years ago). We are also going to use a different data set which contains
various stats on the players as the colleges dataset doesn't have per season stats (we will scrape basketball reference).
